        <h2> Alot...</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>She is the best thing to ever happen to me.</strong> I <strong><em>love</em></strong>
                her to death. She makes me want to be so much more
                than I ever though I could be. Just so that I can 
                make her smile and happy. I traveled across the 
                world for her. And I would do it again swimming if 
                I had to. She's the one. And I'm terrified. What if
                I lose her?  
            </p>

        <h3> I can't stop thinking about her</h3>
        <br>
            <p>
                I wish she saw what I see in her. It kills me to 
                think that she is missing out on what I get to see
                everyday. She takes my breath away and doesn't even
                know. My only regret is not being with her all the 
                time we weren't.
