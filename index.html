    <p>
        <strong>She is the best thing to ever happen to me.</strong> I
        <strong>
            <em>love</em>
        </strong>
        her to death. She makes me want to be so much more than I ever though I could be. Just so that I can make her smile and happy.
        I traveled across the world for her. And I would do it again swimming if I had to. She's the one. And I'm terrified.
        What if I lose her?

        I wish she saw what I see in her. It kills me to think that she is missing out on what I get to see everyday. She takes my
        breath away and doesn't even know. My only regret is not being with her all the time we weren't.
